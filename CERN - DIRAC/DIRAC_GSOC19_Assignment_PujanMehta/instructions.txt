 - The most important commands you ran for running it:
    1) pytest task1.py
    and the inital env setup commands can be considered as the most important ones.

# Task 2 Deliverables
 - The python code is inisde task2.py
 - This test will fail. Why?
    Ans: The test failed because there was no such method "aMethodToMock" inside the object 
         so we had to create it and give it a "return_value" for the proper working.

 - Can you fix this test? Just add 1 line of code, use ​ mock ​ .
    Ans: Yes. I added the following line of code: "fakeObject.aMethodToMock.return_value = 3"

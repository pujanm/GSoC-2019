# Google Summer of Code 2019

My proposals and assignments that I completed while applying to GSoC 2019 at CERN-HSF.

Here I have written a small blog on my [Application Experience](https://pujanm.github.io/2019-05-07-gsoc-application-experience/) with CERN-HSF and I have shared some useful tips too. Hope it helps!

**EDIT:** I have been selected as a GSoC 2019 - Student Developer at CERN-HSF and I will be working on the DIRAC project to imporvise their Monitoring System.
